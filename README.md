***#WEBSITE***

First we have to run the website for that we need React-scripts and node modules. Run npm install and npm start in the terminal 
and then a website will open up. Enter the link into the website and it will be saved as by the name 'myFile.txt'.




***#.IPYNB file***

Then run the Untitled.ipynb file on Google Colab or Jupyter notebook. We need some pre-installed libraries to run the 
jupyter code if there is any problem just search on stack overflow and resolve it according to the solution entered there. 
At the end it will show you if the website is biased or unbiased and if you should continue reading it.
